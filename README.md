# Implementing Concepts

In this repo, I've tried to implement some concept preferably in AI and Machine Learning

## Papers and Blogs
- [Sequential Test-time compute](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/blogpost-scaling-test-time-compute): Implementing the concept of scaling test-time compute for smaller models to perform comparably to larger models.
- *A simple transformer implementation*: A basic implementation of a transformer model to understand its architecture and working.
- [Mixture of Recursion (MoR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10524): Implementing the concept of Mixture of Recursions to improve recursive transformers by dynamically assigning recursive depths to individual tokens.
